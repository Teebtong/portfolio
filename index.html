  <h1>Hello! I'm Steve, a web developer.</h1>

  <p>
    After 12 years of being a nurse, I decided to take a new direction. I feel very strongly about nutrition and food,
    both as a source of healthy sustenance and of enjoyment! My work revolves around making it easier for busy people to
    make healthy food that they enjoy making and eating. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Life isn't all about work, though! I enjoy classic literature and video games, among many other things, so I also 
    work on video games when I have the time and bringing older classics into the new age through interactivity!
  </p>

  <p> On this site you can find examples of my work as well as a description of why I do the work I do.</p>

  <div id="learn-more-text" >
    <p> Want to learn more?</p>

    <button type="button" name="Projects" onclick="window.location.href='projects.html'">View My Projects</button>
    <button type="button" name="Contact" onclick="window.location.href='contact.html'">Get in Touch</button>
